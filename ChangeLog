    commit 43831b87e10e1e2503b625611ab66e00e256e4aa

    This completes the work for release 0.12.0
    (release date not yet scheduled) which enables
    use of mmap or malloc/read when libdwarf
    accesses object section data.

    A major compatibility break requiring
    code calling the library be recompiled with
    the new library.

    Systems without the functions/data to use mmap
    will compile normally, though the compatibility
    break is still applicable.

    Small changes may be required before release.

    Normal automatic update.

    and DW_AT_language_version from DWARF6

    to add either or both to DWARF5
    compiler output are officially allowed to use
    these now.
